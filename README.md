This java program outputs the average time on how long it should take to 100% complete a game

This is a fun little program I made in my Java course that I used for my love for gaming. It demonstrates the use of text textfields, buttons, image & imageview, and also its own CSS file to to have its own custom images and background colors. This program is also interactive by in which depending on the choices selected, it will then output different results.

This program was created by using IDE Eclipse.

Learned:
1. Events & handlers
2. Using CSS for Java programs and as a separate file.
